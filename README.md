Sample project for Cucumber with Scala `2.12.1`.

Project [cucumber-scala-2-12](https://github.com/szarnyasg/cucumber-scala-2-12) used as base, but modified due to errors when executing through IntelliJ.

Plugins needed to execute through IntelliJ:
- Scala (Scala version manager)
- Cucumber for Scala

To execute through IntelliJ run `SimpleTest` class.
To execute through `sbt` just run the command `sbt clean compile test`.
